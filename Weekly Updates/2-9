This week we were only able to work on our PIC interface code because we received our PCB Wednesday morning. We walked through 
each of our functions and how they will communicate with each of the converters and microcontrollers. These plans we talked through 
with Professor Lusher and he approved our work. This upcoming week we will start assembly on our PCB.
