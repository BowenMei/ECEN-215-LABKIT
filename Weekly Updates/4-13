Jon: This week I have continued doing more thorough tests of our functions that I am able to test.
     I found that all of these functions are working as intended once we have the corrections being 
     done in the PIC32. For the oscilloscope, I was able to test the different waveforms that will need
     to be tested in the lab manual. I have continued to assist on the PIC and ESP firmware when Aaron
     and Bowen need assistance.
