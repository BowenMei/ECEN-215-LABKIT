Jon:  For this week, I was working on finding the issue with our oscilloscope design. I have been working with Professor Lusher
      and have found that the design for our channels were designed wrong. Specifically our votlage references. We noticed that 
      they were not outputting the desired 2.048 V. We are working to resolve this issue by adding an additional resistor in order
      to draw a greater resistance. Before, our design caused it to be a ground loop so we were getting a very low voltage. The 
      team and Professor Lusher believe this will fix the issue. Our new resistors should come in the next couple of days and I will 
      add those to our design where I have already made the physical changes. Once this is put in place, I will finalize the testing
      for the oscilloscope and then continue assisting Aaron with the PIC32 microcontroller code.
