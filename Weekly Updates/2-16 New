Aaron:  I otimized and cleaned up my waveform generation code and PIC32 voltage correction code as much as i could.
        I ran the simulations for our voltmeter again with more data points and higher precision to generate a new approximation equation with less calculation error
        We determined a sampling rate for the waveform generator of 1440 Hz (our fastest waveform runs at 1200 Hz)
