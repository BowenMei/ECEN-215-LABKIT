Jon: This week I continued to work on putting on the rest of the parts on our board. As well as test our functions when they are put
      on the board. Last week I was running into the issues of our components not getting the right power. I found the physical issues
      and will need help from Professor Lusher to fix those issues. I believe once these issues are resolved, then the functions should
      be operating correctly. After some testing on the Ohmmeter, we found that the correct output is showing before the op amp but not after.
      For the DC power supplies, the positive supply is consistent with the power from the power distribution function but we are having some
      issues with the negative side. We will conitnue testing all of the functions while we continue working on integrating the PIC code, ESP
      bluetooth and phone application.
