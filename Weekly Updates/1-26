We were able to finish our PCB design, passing all DRC checks and have all the files that the PCB manufactorers would require. The 
PIC programmer was also configured so that it was able to work with the PIC-32, allowing us to now program the PIC-32 MCU using MPLabX.
With the ESP-32, we were able to use the ESP-IDF to run code that allows a ESP-32 devboard to act as a server for the android bluetooth 
client. It still needs some tinkering to change some specifications within the code.
