Jon: This week I finished fixing the op amps in some of our functions. I also put on all the parts for the ohmmeter and ammeter design.
     I began testing these functions and found positive results. Not for all tests though. In the ohmmeter design, only specific resistors
     were outputting properly so there might need to be some hard code done for this function to correct it. The Ammeter design is working but 
     we are getting half of the output we want. We cleaned our board with some of professor Lushers solution but haven't had a chance to test 
     again.
