Jon: For this week, we were giving our final presentation for our project. We have made some progress with the firmware and   
      have been able to load code onto the board for the PIC but we are still having trouble loading code onto the ESP. All of
      the hardware is still working properly. I have just been fine tuning the corrections that will be done in the PIC based off
      of the output I am getting when doing testing. I also have been able to test some of the labs in the ECEN 215 lab manual. By
      doing this I was able to test the Scope/voltmeter, ammeter and ohmmeter. All were working as intended after corrections were
      made.
