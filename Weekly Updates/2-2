This week we were able to get our PCB design approved and ordered through Advanced Circuits (4PCB). We also ordered our remaining parts
necessary for our design and recieved those parts. We also brainstormed and drafted most of our functions for our device so when we start
to code we know how everything communicates. Once we recieve our PCB we will begin soldering and testing each function.
